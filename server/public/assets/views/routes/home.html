            <p>Designed to be a Happy Hour Location Web App, Hosehead is both my end of the curriculum Personal Project from Prime Digital Academy, and a work in progress that I actively update. It is community-driven and easy to access. Locations are user-added, feature Upvote and Downvote counts, and are reportable for false information - becoming unavailable for search until verified.  User Object management includes a user object with activity count and an arbitrary rank based on the aforementioned user activity. A database searchable by zipcode, is hosted on Mongolab. After a successful search you're taken to a 'Results' page, where any results found are displayed with all available information. ‘Add Location’ functionality offers many options for detailing the happy hour location the user can add. The server is written in Node.JS and Express.JS, and is hosted on Heroku. User Authentication is handled in PassportJS, with the Front-end in AngularJS. Bootstrap handles a majority of the finishing touches in the styling department.</p>
