            <p>The Dossier Application is my group project from Prime Digital Academy. The CEO of a local software development agency, had need for the application. It utilizes the google calendar API to link with your google calendar to allow seamless addition of individuals to current or created meetings. Each attendee of the meetings, has an associated profile allowing entry of details such as Interests, Work History, Affiliations, etc. The application is configured to work with an Assistant or Secretary that has delegation access to their Supervisor's google calendar. The benefit to this, is that the Asst. can enter data for individual profiles, and the Supervisor can view them from their phone.</p>
