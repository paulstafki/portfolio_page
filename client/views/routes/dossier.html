            <p>The Dossier Project was the end-of-the-course project during my time at Prime Digital Academy. The CEO of a local software development agency, had need for a Dossier creator application. The application utilizes the google calendar API, to link with your google calendar. Via this connection the application allows seamless addition of individuals to current meetings, and the creation of new meetings within the application. Each email address associated with the meetings, has an associated profile within the application where you can enter details about the individual such as Interests, Work History, Affiliations, etc. The application is configured to work with an Assistant or Secretary that has delegation access to their Supervisor's google calendar. The benefit to this, is that the Asst. can enter data into individual profiles, and the CEO in this case, can view them from his phone while he/she is on the go, eliminating the need for him/her having to return to the office. The application uses a MongoDB database, Node/ExpressJS server, AngularJS and Angular Materials front-end with a bundle of custom Angular directives allowing in-line editing to profile information.</p>
